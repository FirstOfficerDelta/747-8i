Cathay Pacific Cargo "Hong Kong Trader" 748 livery by E-Savageair-

It all began on Sept. 24, 1946 an American, Roy C. Ferrell and an Australian 
Sydney de Kantzow, both ex-air force pilots put up $1 in Hong Kong Money to 
register a new airline.  It would be called Cathay Pacific Airways.  According 
to legend, the name was conceived by Farrell and correspondents at a bar in the 
Manila Hotel, in the Philippines.  The name "Cathay" came from China as 
"Khitan" and "Pacific" to mean that according to Farrell, they would one day 
fly across the Pacific (that would eventually happen in the '70s.)  The Chinese 
name for the company comes from the Chinese idiom "Grand and Peaceful State, and 
at the time was often used by businesses called "Cathay" in english.-  

In 1948, Butterfield and Swire (Now known as Swire Group) Bought 45% of the new 
airline, Australian National Airways taking 35% with Farrell and de Kantzow 
taking 10% of their new airline.-  

The first flight began on July 1, 1948 with a DC-3 nicknamed "Betsy," flying 
routes from Hong Kong, Manila, and on to Singapore, Shanghai, Canton, and 
Sydney.  The airline grew quickly they would then acquire a second DC-3 aircraft
they would name "Niki", and by then they would have three more aircraft.  
Swire later required 52% of the airline; today the Swire Group still holds 45% 
of the airline.-

The airline prospered in the late 1950's, helped by its purchase of Hong Kong 
Airways on July 1, 1959. Cathay Pacific would expand in the '60s, flying to Fukuoka, 
Nagoya, and Osaka in Japan. By 1964 Cathay had flown its one millionth passenger and 
entered into the jet age with their first jet airliner, the Convair 880. In the 1970's 
Cathay Pacific installed computerized reservation systems and flight simulators. CPA 
had already been flying wide-body jets, namely the Lockheed L-1011. In 1979 they would 
buy their first Boeing 747, the first of many. They would go on to be one of the biggest 
operators of the type. The next year, the Hong Kong based airline applied for traffic rights 
flying to London with the first flight taking place on July 16, 1980.-

By the mid '80s CP's destinations would include North American routes flying 
into San Francisco and Vancouver, Canada. Today Cathay Pacific serves 168 
destinations in 42 countries on five continents, with a well-developed Asian 
network. The airline connects to many cites around the world through One world 
and codeshare partners, American Airlines and British Airways, and with French 
national rail operator SNCF, from Paris; they also have access to 17 
destinations in China with its subsidiary, Dragonair, and became the world's 
tenth largest airline measured by sales.-

In 1994, CP introduced the "brushwing" livery that's depicted here, which 
featured the calligraphic stroke against a green background on the vertical 
stabilizer vs. the older green and white striping with the British flag on the 
corner of the tail fin; on the fuselage is white on the top half of the 
aircraft with the powder-blue striping in the middle of the fuselage and a 
lower shade of white near the bottom.  Near the top on upper deck are the 
brandlines, "Asia's world city" and the "Hong Kong" brand logo.
This all would tie in with the handover of the Hong Kong administration 
to the People's Republic of China from the British on July 1, 1997.-

In 1998 on the heels of the handover, Cathay Pacific made some historic steps of 
it's own: On May 21st, CPA took a ceremonial delivery of the first Boeing 777-300 
at Boeing's assembly plant in Everett; on September 21, along with American Airlines, 
British Airways, Canadian Airlines (later to become part of Air Canada), and Qantas 
co-founded the Oneworld airline alliance. It was on July 6, 1998 that became the sign of a 
new era: On that day, Cathay Pacific flight 251 to London Heathrow Airport closed
the chapter on Kai Tak International Airport after 73 years of operation.  
(Kai Tak lives on in FlightGear....) That meant a new chapter was beginning: The next day 
from John F. Kennedy Airport, Cathay flt. 889 flown by Capt. Paul Horsting with 
Capt. Mike Lowes, and First Officer Kelivn Ma was flown in the world's first transpolar
flight from New York to Hong Kong.  Dubbed "Polar One", the flight lasted 16 hours, landing
at the new Hong Kong International Airport, in Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong, beginning a new chapter 
of commercial airline sevrice.  It was Cathay Pacific's longest nonstop flight and the 
longest in the world at 8,055 miles.-

In 2010, Cathay Pacific became the world's largest international cargo airline with
a main hub in Hong Kong International Airport becoming the world's busiest airport
in regards to cargo traffic.  The following year, Cathay would receive the first of its 14 
fleet of 747-8F aircraft for cargo service. On Novemeber 2011, the airline received its 
second 747-8F and this one would be special. To commemorate their new cargo terminal,
Cathay painted the second 747-8F now registered as B-LJA in a unqiue powder-blue and 
white diamond pattern livery with the name "Hong Kong Trader" which was named 
for the very first 747 freighter that entered Cathay Pacific's cargo fleet in 1982.
This is the livery being depicted.-
